We'll study ngn's [solution](https://codeberg.org/ngn/k/src/branch/master/aoc/22/05.k):

[discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/821509511977762827/821511172305846322/1049371710710894692)

And this one is going to be tough.


```ngnk
x:0:"i/05"
e:x?"" /index of empty line
c:(^:)_'(+e#x)1+4*!9 /crates stacks as top-to-bottom strings (including digits)
(m;f;t):0 -1 -1+`I$(+" "\'1_e_x)1 3 5 /(move;from;to)
h:{(x_y;(x#y),z)} /move x items from the beginning of list y to the beginning of list z
g:`0:*'c{[c;m;f;t]@[c;f,t;:;h[m;c f;c t]]}/
g[1;{m}#f;{m}#t] /part1
g[m;f;t]         /part2
```

First line is pretty clear


```ngnk
x?"" /index of the empty line
```

    9


To take the different stacks, the phrase is the folowing:
- From the lines that contain the stacks. (`e#x`)
- Transpose it (`+`)
- We have 9 stacks, so take 9 (`!9`) lines
- We want one every 4 lines (`4*`)
- Starting at 1. 1,5,9,... (`1+`)
- For each of those, (`'`)
- remove whitespace (`(^:)_`)


```ngnk
(^:)_'(+e#x)1+4*!9
```

    ("GBDCPR1"
     "GVH2"
     "MPJDQSN3"
     "MNCDGLSP4"

     "FBDMC8"
     "GQCF9")



```ngnk
*1_e_x
```

    "move 1 from 7 to 4"


Now, for each command line, we want to get the relevant information of `move`, `from`, and `to`:


```ngnk
(m;f;t):0 -1 -1+`I$(+" "\'1_e_x)1 3 5 /(move;from;to)
(*m; *f; *t)
```

    1 6 3


Explanation:

- Take the lines that have move commands (`1_e_x`)
- Split each line by spaces (`" "\'`)
- Transpose (`flip`) the full list, to be able to select the desired fields `1, 3, and 5` by leading axis ([citation needed] https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Leading_axis_theory)
- Select rows 1,3,5
- convert everything to ints ``` `I$```
- subtract 1 from `from` and `to`, so the numbers map to our 0-index nature


```ngnk
/ why the `flip`
(" "\'5#1_e_x)
(+" "\'5#1_e_x)
```

    (("move";,"1";"from";,"7";"to";,"4")
     ("move";,"3";"from";,"4";"to";,"7")
     ("move";,"4";"from";,"3";"to";,"4")
     ("move";,"5";"from";,"6";"to";,"9")
     ("move";,"1";"from";,"8";"to";,"1"))
    (("move";"move";"move";"move";"move")
     (,"1";,"3";,"4";,"5";,"1")
     ("from";"from";"from";"from";"from")
     (,"7";,"4";,"3";,"6";,"8")
     ("to";"to";"to";"to";"to")
     (,"4";,"7";,"4";,"9";,"1"))


`h` is a simple function to shift `x` number of elements elements from `y` to `z`, preserving the order. 


```ngnk
h:{(x_y;(x#y),z)}
```


```ngnk
h[2;0 1 2 3; 4 5 6]
```

    (2 3
     0 1 4 5 6)



```ngnk
h[1;(0 1 2; 10 11 12); (4 5 6; 14 15 16)]
```

    (,10 11 12
     (0 1 2;4 5 6;14 15 16))


Now this starts to be fun again:


```ngnk
g:`0:*'c{[c;m;f;t]@[c;f,t;:;h[m;c f;c t]]}/
```

This line defines a function `g`. If we split it into meaningful parts, we get:
- Define function `g:`
- print the first of each ``` `0:*'```
- over  (`c f /`)
- `f` being a tetradic function
- And what `f` does is to `Amend` `c`, in the indices `f,t`, setting as values (`:`), the result of `h` `@[c;f,t;:;h[m;c f;c t]]`

A function definition that ends with `/` tells us that the full body will be applied to the parameters it'll get when called. It's kind of a literal, that could be inlined.


```ngnk
ff:`0:*'c{[c;m;f;t]@[c;f,t;:;h[m;c f;c t]]}/
ff[1; (1 2 3); (1 2 3)]
```

## Detour #1, `over`

We'll digress a bit, and write a few tests on `over` with a simple triadic function, to see how it behaves depending on the shapes of the arguments

Reading the holy [kreflite.pdf](http://www.nsl.com/k/k2/k295/kreflite.pdf) doc on `over`:

[...]each argument other than the first can be an atom or list,
but if two or more of those are lists then all those lists must conform. The first
argument x is any valid first argument of f.

The general case of Over for functions with valence at least two is a direct exten-
sion of the dyadic case. The first argument x serves the same role as the left argu-
ment of the dyadic case, and all other arguments have the same role as the right
argument. That is, if all of y, z,... are atoms then f/[x;y;z;...] is identical to
f[x;y;z;...] , and otherwise f/[x;y;z;...] is evaluated as follows:
```
x: f[x;y0;z0;...]
x: f[x;y1;z1;...]
.
.
.
x: f[x;yn;zn;...]
```
where y0 is y[0] if y is a list or y itself if y is an atom, and similarly for y1...yn,
z0...zn. The name yn stands for the last item of y if y is a list or y itself if y is an
atom, and similarly for zn, ... . The result is the last value of x.

And, as usual in K, this description holds a lot of non-trivial behaviors that you can exploit when needed. Let's see a few examples with a triadic sum `{x+y+z}`:


```ngnk
`simple
{x+y+z}/[2;1;0]       / same as {x+y+z}[2;1;0] (2+1+0)
{x+y+z}/[2 1;1;0]     / same as {x+y+z}[2 1;1;0]  (2 1 + 1 + 0)
{x+y+z}/[2 1 0;1;0]   / same as {x+y+z}[2 1 0;1;0]  (2 1 0 + 1 + 0)
/so far, no iterations have happened on over. Everything happened in one call of the function, and as `+` is atomic, everything just works.

`iterate
{x+y+z}/[0;2 1 0;3]   / 0+2+3  + 1+3  + 0+3. scalar, because first arg is scalar

`conform
{x+y+z}/[2 1 0;1 0;3] / `1 0` and `3` conform.
{x+y+z}/[2 1 0;1 0;3 0] / `1 0` and `3 0` conform.
{x+y+z}/[2 1 0;1 0;3 0 0] / `1 0` and `3 0 0` do not conform. 'lenght error

`recurrence
{x+y+z}\[10;2;1;3]    / recurrence
{x+y}\[10;1;1] / fib 
+\[10;1;1] / also fib
```

    `simple
    3
    3 2
    3 2 1
    `iterate
    12
    `conform
    9 8 7
    6 5 4
    'length
     {x+y+z}/[2 1 0;1 0;3 0 0] / `1 0` and `3 0 0` do not conform. 'lenght error
                             ^
    
    `recurrence
    2 1 3 6 10 19 35 64 118 217 399 734 1350
    1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144
    1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144


The last section (recurrence) is an undocumented extension to ngn/k:

ngn: [...]I made a small undocumented extension to k6 in my implementation: dyad\[nIterations;seed1;seed2] computes the first n terms of a recurrence relation, e.g. +\[10;1;1] is the fibonacci sequence. [discord link](https://discord.com/channels/821509511977762827/821511172305846322/1065755527734370346).

If you're wondering about the behaviors on the valence of `f` vs number of args given to `f/`, [that's your link](https://ngn.codeberg.page/txt/slash.html)

**note on parsing**

In the case of `over`, the first parameter (seed), can be either passed along in the bracketed piece, or as a left argument. Keep in mind though, that when passing args in brackets, `42{[c;m;f] c}/[1;1]` is parsed as `42 @ {[c;m;f] c}/[1;1]`. Square brackets stick tightly to the term on the left, as if they are an adverb. so, `x f/[y;z]` parses like `x (f/[y;z])`.

`(42{[c;m;f] c}/)[1;1]` does the right thing though.

Examples:


```ngnk
// defining a function
/seed as part of the args
t:{[c;m;f] c}/
t[42;1;1]

/ seed on the left
t:42{[c;m;f] c}/
t[1;1]

// inline
/ seed as part of the args 
{[c;m;f] c}/[42;1;1]

/ use parenthesis
(43{[c;m;f] c}/)[1;1]

/ seed as left arg. rank error
42{[c;m;f] c}/[1;1] 
```

    42
    42
    42
    43
    'rank
     42{[c;m;f] c}/[1;1]
       ^
    


## Detour #2: Tables indexing tables

Take a look at the following lines. we define 2 lists, and well.. we index one with the other. 

That means we get `#p` elements.  It's the same as `t[p]`, or `t@p` but just wanted to note yet another way.


```ngnk
t:1 2 3
p:0 0 1
t p
t[p]
t@p
```

    1 1 2
    1 1 2
    1 1 2


## Detour #3 (`take` with a monad `m#l` )

Take and cut are very powerful and polymorphic. 

In this solution, there's a case of `m@l`.  Take will evaluate `m l`, and use the return value as a repeat count for each one of `l`.

If it returns a scalar, each value will be repeated that number of times.

Let's see some examples:


```ngnk
{1}#!5
{0}#!5
{x}#!5
{|x}#!5
{#x}#!5
```

    0 1 2 3 4
    !0
    1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4
    0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 3
    0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4


Here are some examples of the real movements we are doing a bit down.


```ngnk
10#m
10#f
10#m f
10#{m}#f
10#{m}#t

```

    1 3 4 5 1 2 3 1 9 1
    6 3 2 5 7 2 3 2 6 1
    3 5 4 2 1 4 5 4 3 3
    6 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 5 5
    3 6 6 6 3 3 3 3 8 8


## Back to the challenge


```ngnk
c 2 2 2
*f
*t
h[1; *c f; *c t]
```

     "MPJDQSN3"

    ("TFHMZB7"
     "QMNCDGLSP4")



```ngnk
g:`0:*'c{[c;m;f;t]@[c;f,t;:;h[m;c f;c t]]}/
g[1;{m}#f;{m}#t] /part1
```

    TLNGFGMFN


The solution to the challenge uses the 3 things we just reviewed plus `Amend`. 

Amend is an incredibly powerful function. From kreflite.pdf:
```
@[d;i;f;y]

Modify the items of the list d at indices i with f and, if present, the atom or list y,
and similarly for the dictionary d at entries i.
```

It's like an array version of clojure's `update` (on steroids).

Intuitively, knowing what amend does, and what `h` does, we can imagine how the flow is going, but I'd say, take the time to see how it works. It's just beautiful.


What ngn does here is quite smart. instead of reversing the top elements of the "from" stack before putting them on top of the "to" stack, he replicates the "from" command "m" times, so the evaluation of the program will effectively do the reverse.

If the first line is "move 1 from 7 to 4" it'll call `g[1;7;4]`.

If another one is "move 3 from 4 to 5" it'll call `g[1;4 4 4;5 5 5]`.

When used as parameters to `over`, they will be "sent" to amend one by one, so `c 4` and `c 5` will be evaluated against the updated values of `c` in each step. 

Part two is a variant where the crane is able to pull as many blocks at once as it wants, so there's no need for reversal


```ngnk
g[m;f;t]         /part2
```

Congrats, we made it! 

Now, deep breath
