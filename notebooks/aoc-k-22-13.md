We'll study ngn's [solution](https://codeberg.org/ngn/k/src/branch/master/aoc/22/13.k):


```ngnk
x:_`j?''2#'0N 3#0:"i/13"

// c:{a:(x~*x;y~*y)
//    $[&/a;(x>y)-x<y
//      &/~a;0^*(~:)_o'/((&/n)#'(x;y)),'n:(#x;#y)
//      o.(!0),/:(x;y)]}
// +/1+&0>c/'x                 /part1
// */1 2+/'0<(,,2;,,6)c/:\:,/x /part2
```

This problem shouldn't be very difficult: We have to check which ones of the pairs of json arrays are "sorted", according to a set of rules provided by the exercise.

First, read the input:

- Read the file
- reshape to rows of 3 "columns". That effectively joins lines in groups of 3
- For each group of 3 lines, resize to 2. That means, remove the ending blank line
- For each group, for each element, parse json ``` `j? ```
- _ no idea


```ngnk
1~*(1;2)
```

    1



```ngnk
3#0:"i/13" /from this
1#x        /to this
```

    ("[[5],[1,[[0]]],[],[3,[[9,1],[3,4,10],8,3],6]]"
     "[[],[[6,8],4]]"
     "")
    ,""


Now, the fun part
```
c:{a:(x~*x;y~*y)
   $[&/a;(x>y)-x<y
     &/~a;0^*(~:)_o'/((&/n)#'(x;y)),'n:(#x;#y)
     o.(!0),/:(x;y)]}
```

- `a` becomes the tuple `x;y`, that we'll use for the conditional.

- If both x and y are the same as their first element, that means that they are atoms or single element lists
- That means that, in this case, the min `&/a` will be 1, so the result of `c` is the result of `(x>y)-x<y`.


```ngnk
1~*1
(1 2)~*(1 2)
1~*(1)
(1)~*(1)
((1))~*(1 2)
```

    1
    0
    1
    1
    1


- `(x>y)-x<y` returns -1 if x<y, 0 if x=y , 1 if x>y


```ngnk
{(x>y)-x<y}[0 1 2;2 1 0]
```

    -1 0 1


- When the min `&/~a` will be 1 means that all of the elements of `a` are 0. They all were lists with more than 1 element

`&/~a;0^*(~:)_o'/((&/n)#'(x;y)),'n:(#x;#y)`


There's some recursivity here, because we have to drill into the nested structure. In K, the current function is accessible via `o`
Even without looking in detail, we see that there's some enumeration of the elements of `x` and `y` (`n:(#x;#y)`, and we can assume that somehow, the recursive function will pair the elements and call recursively. That would be reasonable.

Let's examine the first part: `((&/n)#'(x;y)),'n:(#x;#y)`.

This reshapes both arguments to the size of the smallest.
- `n:(#x;#y)`. `n` is the list of the 2 sizes
- `(&/n)#` Reshape to the min of `n`


```ngnk
{(&/n)#'(x;y),'n:(#x;#y)}[|!10;!5]
```

    (9 8 7 6 5
     0 1 2 3 4)



```ngnk

```
