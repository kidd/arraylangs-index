We'll study ngn's [solution](https://codeberg.org/ngn/k/src/branch/master/aoc/22/11.k):


```ngnk

/(items;operation;divBy;throwIfTrue;throwIfFalse)
M:{w:m!O[x]'v x;v[x]:!0;#v[(f x;t x)@~d[x]!w],:w} /monkey x inspects available items

We have everything prepared, lists of items, ops, divBy, ifTrue, ifFalses.
part1 runs 20 iterations of g.

`g`, runs the 20 iterations of each one of the monkeys doing things. Let's see:


```ngnk
g:{v::a;*/r@2#>r:+/{M'!#v}'!x} /product of top2 after x rounds
```

Something we hadn't seen yet is a function with multiple expressions.
Even if each expression is evaluated right-to-left, if a function has many expressions, the expressions go left-to-right. It's not as strange, if you think that you could split that into two lines instead of `;`.

- First, we assign `a` to the global `v` (`::`).
- Then, we do the second expression, which
- iterates as many times as the parameter that gets passed (`'!x`)
- Evaluates `M` for each 0..#v (which is `a`). Don't worry about `M` now
- sum-over the result, and assign to `r`
- get the 2 biggest ones `r@2#>r`
- times-over the two monkeys

With this, it's clear that `M` is for Monkey.


```ngnk
M:{w:m!O[x]'v x;v[x]:!0;#v[(f x;t x)@~d[x]!w],:w} /monkey x inspects available items
```

Again, a multiexpression function.  Expressions are `w:m!O[x]'v x`, `v[x]:!0`, and `#v[(f x;t x)@~d[x]!w],:w`

A few things to note:

- This function will be called with 0..#v as parameter, refering to the monkey at hand. So it'll be called once per monkey turn.
- remember that we assigned to global `v`? There has to be a reason for it... Probably we're going to mutate it, right?
- The function is `M`onkey, and the `x` argument is the monkey number. Think about it when seeing `x` around here. It usually indexes on our data

First expression is already





```ngnk
{:w:m!O[x]'v x}
```

    {:w:m!O[x]'v x}


O is the fns for each monkey. so `-3!O[x]'v x` evaluates the monkey operation to the different objects the monkey has. And does the `div 3` for each one of the results.


```ngnk
O
m:-3
m
O[0]'v 0
```

    ({[old]old * 11}
     {[old]old + 8}
     {[old]old * 3}
     {[old]old + 4}
     {[old]old * old}
     {[old]old + 2}
     {[old]old + 3}
     {[old]old + 5})
    -3
    14985190 96587590 102958240 81994990 95001280 63492880 730180 17304628



```ngnk
v[x]:!0 /resets monkey inventory of objects
```

And now, the tour de force: `#v[(f x;t x)@~d[x]!w],:w`

- This looks like an amend item `v[i],:w` followed by `count`.
- `d[x]!w` takes the divideBy of the Monkey, and divides the item worriness by it.
- `~` makes it a 0 or 1
- which we apply (`@`) to either return `f x` or `t x`. that result tells us to which monkey we are sending that object.
- that's where the amend item comes into play: `v[destination],:w`
- size of that monkey's inventory
